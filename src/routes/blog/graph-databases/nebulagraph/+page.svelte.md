# NebulaGraph

Should I look into NebulaGraph? I found this comment in a [HackerNews thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22051830):

(Sherman here. I'm the founder of Nebula) Nice to meet you here, Manish. Nebula is actually inspired by the Facebook internal project Dragon ([Dragon: A distributed graph query engine](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/03/18/data-infrastructure/dragon-a-distributed-graph-query-engine/)). Fortunately I was one of the founding members of the project. The project was started in 2012. We never heard of dgraph at that time. So I'm not sure who was inspired :-)
The goal of Nebula is to be a general graph database, not just a knowledge graph database. There are some fundamental differences between the two.

As of this writing (Oct 2024), NebulaGraph Cloud is in beta and does not appear to work. I tried using NebulaGraph, but did not get very far. So I sent them an email about two weeks ago and still have not heard anything back. This was my email:

NebulaGraph seems to be the most mysterious of any graph database I have looked at. 

* They claim to have been around for a while, but it doesn't seem like anyone knows anything about them. I have only been able to find two reviews about their database.
* I am not sure where they are headquartered. They seem to be headquartered in China, but I am not certain about that.
* They make a lot of interesting claims about their database, but I can't even get an instance running in their cloud platform.

When you are evaluating databases you want to find information that gives you the sense that this is a solid database with a solid company behind it, but I am left with a very mysterious feeling about NebulaGraph, which seems sketchy.

Hello NebulaGraph Team,

I signed up for NebulaGraph Cloud today and tried to use it, but was unable to. These are a few of the issues that I ran into:

1. I was able to subscribe once and create a database, but when I tried creating another database I was unable to add billing information or subscribe to the service and was unable to create a new database.
2. I was unable to logout of NebulaGraph Cloud. After logging out, I went back to https://cloud.nebula-graph.io/ so I could try creating a new database again, but I was redirected back to the dashboard. I had to clear cookies manually to actually get logged out.
3. I was going to submit a ticket/case to report these issues, but was unable to create an account in your Atlassian service desk. I just kept getting errors when I tried creating an account.

I would like to try NebulaGraph Cloud when these issues have been resolved. Please let me know when that happens.

Thank you!
