# Amazon Neptune

Startups and indie developers beware. Like everything else offered by AWS, this database is targeted at enterprise-level customers. If you search for "how much does neptune serverless cost" you will see something like this:

"Amazon Neptune Serverless costs at least $290 per month, even if you don't use the database. The cost is based on how much you use, measured in Neptune capacity units (NCUs) per hour. Each NCU is roughly equivalent to 2 gibibytes (GiB) of memory, along with the corresponding CPU and networking."
