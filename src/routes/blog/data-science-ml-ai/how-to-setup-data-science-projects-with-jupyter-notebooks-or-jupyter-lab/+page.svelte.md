# How To Setup Data Science Projects with Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab

## Install Anaconda3

1. Go to Anaconda's website and install Anaconda for your operating system.
2. After Anaconda is installed, then make sure that Python3 and Pip3 are on your PATH variable. In a terminal run `which python3` and then `which pip3`. Those commands should return a file path to your Anaconda installation.
3. `conda` is Anaconda's package manager. Make sure that your conda installation worked: `conda --version`. If that returns a version number, then you have installed Anaconda3 and conda correctly.

## Use Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab inside of a virtual environment (RECOMMENDED)

Every data science project you do will require some combination of external libraries, sometimes with specific versions that differ from the specific versions you used for other projects. If you were to have a single Python installation, these libraries would conflict and cause you all sorts of problems. 

The standard solution is to use virtual environments, which are sandboxed Python environments that maintain their own versions of Python libraries (and, depending on how you set up the environment, of Python itself).

As a matter of good discipline, you should always work in a virtual environment, and never use the "base" Python installation.

### Step 1: Create an `environment.yml` file in your project root directory

You can create and activate virtual environments with conda. (See [Managing environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).)

First, create an `environment.yml` file in your project root directory. Here is an example of an `environment.yml` file:

<Highlight 
  language="yaml"
  code={`name: name-of-virtual-environment
channels:
  - conda
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python==3.12
  - pip==24.2
  - scikit-learn==1.5.1
  - pandas==2.2.2
  - seaborn==0.13.2
  - imbalanced-learn==0.12.3
  - numpy==2.0.0
  - matplotlib==3.9.1
  - kmodes==0.12.2
  - python-graphviz==0.20.3
  - six==1.16.0
  - pydotplus==2.0.2
  - statsmodels==0.14.2
  - ipykernel==6.29.5 
  - jupyterlab==4.2.4`}
/>

**What is `ipykernel`?**

*The Jupyter Notebook and other frontends automatically ensure that the IPython kernel is available. However, if you want to use a kernel with a different version of Python, or in a virtualenv or conda environment, youâ€™ll need to install that manually.* (Source [Installing the IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#:~:text=The%20IPython%20kernel%20is%20the,need%20to%20install%20that%20manually.))

The `environment.yml` file assumes that you are using JupyterLab instead of Jupyter Notebooks. So you would be able to run it inside of a virtual environment in a pretty automated and easy way. I don't think that is possible with Jupyter Notebooks, but I could be wrong.

NOTE: If you need to use Jupyter Notebooks (instead of JupyterLab), then I think you will have to install `ipykernel` and run Jupyter Notebooks inside a virtual environment a different (and more manual) way. This process is detailed in the Preface of the book "Data Science for Marketing Analytics".

For reference, here is an `environment.yml` file that could be used with a Python backend for web development, if you are not using Docker as your development environment:

<Highlight 
  language="yaml"
  code={`# This file is used with conda virtual environments for development. 
# Docker development environments use the requirements.txt file.
name: name-of-virtual-environment
dependencies:
  - python=3.12
  - pip=24.2
  # You need to list pip as a dependency and then list any packages that need to be 
  # installed by pip after all the dependencies that are to be installed by conda.
  # https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#using-pip-in-an-environment
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61715343/solving-environment-failed-when-trying-to-set-up-python-virtual-envrironment
  - pip:
    - litestar[standard]==2.12.1
    # - uvicorn==0.32.0 # litestar[standard] includes commonly used extras like uvicorn, so it is not necessary to specify uvicorn as a separate package.
    - python-dotenv==1.0.1
    - pyjwt==2.9.0
    - python-multipart==0.0.12
    - aiofiles==24.1.0
    - FalkorDB==1.1.1 # Graph database`}
/>

### Step 2: Create your virtual environment

In a terminal window `cd` into your project directory and run

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="conda env create -f environment.yml"
/>

This will install the virtual environment that is specified in your `environment.yml` file. In case you see a prompt asking you to confirm before proceeding, type `y` and press Enter to continue creating the environment. Depending on your system configuration, it may take a while for the process to complete.

### Step 3: Verify that the new virtual environment was installed correctly

In your terminal type:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="conda env list"
/>

You should see the name of your virtual environment in that list, which is the `name` specified in your `environment.yml` file.

### Step 4.a.: Use Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode

There are a few different notebook options that you can use. These instructions show you how to use Jupyter Notebooks inside VSCode.

NOTE: Make sure that you have the Polyglot Notebooks extension installed in VS Code. This extension provides support for Jupyter Notebooks inside of VSCode.

1. Open your project folder in VSCode.
2. Create a new file with this naming convention: `<file-name>.ipynb`. VSCode will open the file inside a notebook.
3. If you get a message in VSCode that says, ".NET 9 SDK REQUIRED", then click the "Install here" link that follows the message and follow the instructions.
4. Activate Your Virtual Environment: 
    1. In the top left corner of the notebook file you will see a button for `Select Kernel`. (NOTE: That button looks more like a label than a button.)
    2. Click that button >> `Python Environments...` >> Select the virtual environment that you created previously. 
    3. You should now see that `Select Kernel` has been replaced by the virtual environment that you selected.

### Step 4.b. (Alternative): Use JupyterLab inside your virtual environment

There are a few different notebook options that you can use. These instructions show you how to use JupyterLab inside your virtual environment.

#### Step 4.b.i: Activate your virtual environment

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="conda activate <name-of-virtual-environment>"
/>

Once your virtual environment has been activated, your command prompt should be prefixed with the name of your virtual environment. For example:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="(name-of-virtual-environment) ~/path/to/data/science/project(name-of-git-branch)$"
/>

#### Step 4.b.ii.: Run JupyterLab inside your virtual environment

Run the following command inside your activated virtual environment:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="jupyter-lab"
/>

When you run `jupyter-lab` the JupyterLab server will run and an instance of JupyterLab will open up in a browser window. The following are a couple of indicators that you are running JupyterLab from inside a virtual environment:

1. The output in the terminal where you ran `jupyter-lab` should have the following two lines *(which indicate that JupyterLab is being served from the `/path/to/anaconda3/envs/` directory, which is where the virtual environments are stored)*:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code={`[I 2022-09-07 09:31:23.835 LabApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /path/to/anaconda3/envs/ds-marketing/lib/python3.9/site-packages/jupyterlab
[I 2022-09-07 09:31:23.835 LabApp] JupyterLab application directory is /path/to/anaconda3/envs/ds-marketing/share/jupyter/lab`}
/>

2. When JupyterLab first loads up in your browser, under the "Launcher" tab you will see options for "Python 3 (ipykernel)" under the "Notebook" and "Console" headings.

## Additional virtual environment management commands

### How to update packages in a virtual environment

You may need to update your environment for a variety of reasons. For example, it may be the case that:

* One of your core dependencies just released a new version (dependency version number update).
* You need an additional package for data analysis (add a new dependency).
* You have found a better package and no longer need the older package (add new dependency and remove old dependency).

If any of these occur, all you need to do is update the contents of your `environment.yml` file accordingly and then run the following commands in your terminal:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code={`conda deactivate
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune`}
/>

**Note**

The `--prune` option causes conda to remove any dependencies that are no longer required from the environment.

See [Updating an environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#updating-an-environment).

### How to deactivate a virtual environment

When you are done working on a particular project you can deactivate the virtual environment with:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="conda deactivate"
/>

See [Deactivating an environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#deactivating-an-environment)

### How to delete a virtual environment

First make sure your environment is deactivated. Then run this command:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="conda env remove --name <name-of-environment>"
/>

You can verify that your virtual environment has been deleted by running

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="conda env list"
/>

## Use JupyterLab outside of a virtual environment (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Install JupyterLab with `pip`:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="pip install jupyterlab"
/>

Note: If you install JupyterLab with conda or mamba, it is recommended to use the `conda-forge` channel.

Check that JupyterLab installed correctly:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="jupyter-lab --version"
/>

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

<Highlight 
  language="bash"
  code="jupyter-lab"
/>
