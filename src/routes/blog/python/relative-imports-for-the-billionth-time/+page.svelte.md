# Relative imports for the billionth time

The title of this StackOverflow post "[Relative imports for the billionth time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative-imports-for-the-billionth-time)" seems to capture the feeling of Python imports pretty well. Simply put, they are confusing.

I want to research all the answers in this SO post thoroughly and provide clear explanations for each term and provide examples to help illustrate everything very clearly.

This post will probably bring together the concepts from a few of my other posts.

Research Resources:

* [The Import System](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html)

Concepts that need clarification:

* What is a Python package (see my other post)
* Installed packages vs local packages (is "local package" the correct term?)
* Scripts vs Modules (see my other post)
* What is `from __future__ import absolute_import`. Canit help in this situation?
* The `__name__` dunder variable (see my other post)
* Python interpreter vs Interactive Python interpreter. Is there a difference or did the authors of the some of the answers just use those terms interchangeably?
